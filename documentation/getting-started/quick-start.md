## Building Mongock: Annotation vs builder

When using Mongock\(and Changock in general\) you can use it in two main ways: with annotations\(when provided support\), which does all the boiled plates for you, or manually with Mongock Drivers.

Specifically for Mongock, while Spring runners provide both mechanisms, standalone only supports builder support.
